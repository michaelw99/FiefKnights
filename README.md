# FiefKnights (studio name WIP)
Though our game is still in its very early stages, we are working hard towards a polished vertical slice every day!

## Our Untitled Metroidvania Beat'em Up
Explore a massive ancient city in the sky, discover the history of its downfall and disappearance and make a few friends along the way. Weave through enemies with fast-paced close-quarters combat, discover ancient relics and technology, explore and grow stronger to face the challenges before you. 

### Story
A large landmass suddenly appears in the sky. Upon it, a massive city looms, filled with potential riches and history. The nations below scramble to get their hands on what's inside. They establish an Explorer's Guild to make expeditions within. You, the MC, manage to sneak aboard an airship, and make an explosive entrance into the city's workshop. Explore and delve into this antiquated city, earn your keep as an unofficial explorer, make friends, and unveil a truth that may change history as you know it.

### Gameplay
This is a Metroidvania at its core, but we want to pivot away with a more complex combat system. In a more classic system, the player would be expected to carefully avoid the enemy's attacks, and gt in hits in between attack patterns. In our game, we want to encourage the player to get right in there and maintain the offensive, while using their combat abilities to weave out of the enemy's strikes. The best defence is a good offense.
#### Exploration
Platforming exploration as you would expect. The MC gains new movement abilities as they explore which will allow them to explore more of the city. Focus on environmental storytelling and immersion. 
#### Combat
There will be a basic light/heavy combo system. The player is also able to use **skills** at any point to keep up their combo and avoid damage. There are different weapons that can be swapped into at anytime that serve different purposes. The player is rewarded for keeping up the pressure on enemies.
##### Skills
These active skills empower the player to be the lightning quick melee fighter they were meant to be. These provide players options to avoid damage quickly, while also maintaining the offensive. With proper use and quick reflexes, the player should be able to avoid most incoming attacks without having to back off from the enemy. For example, "Backflip kick" launches the player into the air while hitting the area in front of them; this can be used to avoid a low attack, and the player can follow up with a dive kick immediately after and get back into the action. 
##### Weapons
The player will discover new weapons as they progress, which they can switch into at any time. They will have **elemental attributes** which will be essential to demolishing enemies efficiently. For example, if an enemy attacks with a vine whip, the *fire daggers* will burn the whip, stunning the enemy.
##### Break
Enemies have a "break gauge" that fills when they are hit, and depletes when they are not. Filling it stuns the enemy, and doing that several times will allow you to finish the enemy instantly!
